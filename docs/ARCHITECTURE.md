# Life Tracker Pro - Architecture Decision Record

## State Management: Redux Toolkit (Chosen)

### Decision
We decided to **continue using Redux Toolkit** instead of migrating to React Query.

### Status
✅ **DECIDED** - Redux Toolkit with RTK Query patterns

### Context
The application currently uses Redux Toolkit for state management with the following characteristics:
- Single `activitySlice` managing dashboard data
- Async thunks for API calls
- Good TypeScript integration
- Proper error handling and loading states

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Redux Toolkit (CHOSEN ✅)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Already implemented and working
- ✅ Excellent TypeScript support
- ✅ Predictable state updates
- ✅ Time travel debugging
- ✅ Good for complex state logic
- ✅ Team familiarity

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More boilerplate than React Query
- ⚠️ Manual cache invalidation

#### Option 2: React Query (REJECTED ❌)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Better server state management
- ✅ Automatic background refetching
- ✅ Built-in caching and invalidation
- ✅ Less boilerplate for API calls

**Cons:**
- ❌ Major refactoring required
- ❌ Learning curve for team
- ❌ Overkill for current simple state
- ❌ Additional bundle size

### Decision Rationale

1. **Current State Works Well**: Our Redux implementation is clean, typed, and functional
2. **Simple Requirements**: We have minimal server state complexity
3. **Development Efficiency**: No need for major refactoring
4. **Bundle Size**: Already optimized without additional dependencies
5. **Team Productivity**: Team is familiar with Redux patterns

### Implementation Plan

Instead of migrating, we'll **optimize our Redux setup**:

1. ✅ Keep current Redux Toolkit setup
2. 🔄 Add RTK Query for future complex API needs (optional)
3. 🔄 Implement optimistic updates where needed
4. 🔄 Add data normalization if state grows complex

### Future Considerations

- **If API complexity grows significantly**: Consider RTK Query (Redux-based solution)
- **If server state becomes predominant**: Reevaluate React Query
- **For new projects**: Consider React Query for server-heavy apps

### Monitoring

We'll monitor:
- Bundle size impact
- Developer experience
- State complexity growth
- API caching needs
